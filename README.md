An analytics abstraction layer for projects based in swift. Can be used in the server and client side.

# Inspiration

This is heavily inspired in the [Alicerce 🏗](https://github.com/mindera/alicerce) [analytics layer](https://github.com/Mindera/Alicerce/tree/master/Sources/Analytics) 🙇‍

This is probably the best, simple and complete abstraction layer for analytics that the world has ever seen 🌍

## **What is the purpose of this repo?**

The analytics layer in the [Alicerce 🏗](https://github.com/mindera/alicerce) is not ready to work in the server side and linux environment.

[Alicerce 🏗](https://github.com/mindera/alicerce) is not ready to be imported in modules with `Swift Package Manager` which is the preferrable dependency manager in the server side world 🌍

This is probably a temporary repository while [Alicerce 🏗](https://github.com/mindera/alicerce) is not ready for `Swift Package Manager` with modules and linux.

# Installation 🤝

Currently, it only supports Swift Package Manager

## Swift Package Manager
